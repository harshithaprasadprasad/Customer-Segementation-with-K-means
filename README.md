# Customer-Segementation-with-K-means
Customer segmentation using K-Means groups customers into five distinct clusters based on their annual income and spending score. The clusters represent different customer types such as low income–low spending, low income–high spending, high income–low spending, high income–high spending, and medium income–medium spending.
